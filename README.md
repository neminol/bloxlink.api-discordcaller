# bloxlink.api-discordcaller
This script uses Bloxlink API's function to check Discord IDs for any connected Roblox Accounts through RoVer.
This script does an API Call in seconds instead of having to wait and trying to find the documentation.
The output is technically in .json but can be read out easily, like the normal .json.

Oh and, here's the API documentation cause these guys are ALSO cool.

Ratelimit is 60 requests/60 seconds. The endpoint can change any time. Be sure to watch the documentation and inform me if it changes.
